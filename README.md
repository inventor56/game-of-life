The Game of Life - Including Classic, Doughnut, and Mirror Modes!

// Code by Joshua Smith

// The Game of Life:
// This program will run the Game of Life simulation. It works by using multi-dimensional arrays
// which are all of the same size. However, these arrays are each 1 row bigger and 1 column bigger
// than the original grids, so that we can run more modes in the game (Doughnut/Mirror).

// One of the big challenges in this program was trying to iterate and index through all these
// arrays, and so I decided to try and break up the program into smaller methods. That way, I was
// able to clearly focus on which methods did what.

// The program begins by setting up the game:
//	The player chooses whether to use a file with the dimensions listed and a grid
//		or:
//	The player opts to use a randomly generated grid based off of their input
//
//	The player then is asked whether they want to play classic, doughnut, or mirror mode.
//
//	Next, the player can choose to either have the simulation pause for them, wait for
//	their input (like the enter key), or have the results printed out to a file name of
//	their choice! ***********PAUSE MODE IS NOT WORKING ON THE LINUX VM******************
//
// The program then runs the game:
//
//	The game checks the grid and applies the game rules to it. The new grid is stored in a
//	separate 2D array, so that we don't mess up the simulation rules. After it's all done,
//	the array is copied back to the original one so we can start again for the next generation.
//
//	The game ends when the grid either empties out or stablizes.
//
// Enjoy!!!


Comments:
	- I used an array that was 2 rows and 2 columns bigger than the original grid so that I could
	  check for empty spaces (classic mode), wrapped around references (doughnut mode), and
	  references reflected back (mirror mode).
	
Issues:
	- Since I made the program through the Linux VM, system("pause") doesn't work. It just
	  waits for the user to hit a key on the keyboard.
	- I used cin.get() to wait for user input to continue. But, there seems to be a bug where
	  it automatically prints out the original generation as well as the next generation.
